This is a sample README file for a Twitter clone project. The Twitter clone is a web application that emulates many of the core features of Twitter, including posting tweets, following other users, and viewing a timeline of recent tweets.

Getting Started
To use the Twitter clone, users can navigate to the website's URL and create an account to start using the platform. Users can also log in with their existing Twitter account to access the clone's features.

Features
The Twitter clone offers a range of features that emulate the functionality of the original Twitter platform, including:

User Profiles: The clone allows users to create and customize their own profiles, including a profile picture and bio.

Tweeting: Users can post tweets, including text, images, and links, and view tweets from other users on their timeline.

Following: Users can follow other users to see their tweets on their timeline and receive notifications when they post new content.

Hashtags: The clone allows users to use hashtags to categorize and search for tweets related to specific topics.

Notifications: Users receive notifications when they are mentioned in a tweet, when someone likes or retweets their content, or when they receive a new follower.

Technologies Used
The Twitter clone is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and to store in recoil user and tweet information. The application is designed to be mobile-responsive and accessible on a variety of devices.
