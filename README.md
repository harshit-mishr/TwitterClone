Features
The Twitter clone offers a range of features that emulate the functionality of the original Twitter platform, including:

User Profiles: The clone allows users to create and customize their own profiles, including a profile picture.

Tweeting: Users can post tweets, including text, images and view tweets from other users on their timeline.

Following: Users can follow other users to see their tweets on their timeline and see new content.

Technologies Used
